# CCC-newsfeed
A simple voting system for curating news items for the Consortium feed

When a member wants to add an item to the news feed for the Confidential Computing Consortium, they should create an issue. The issue title should be the 'headline' and the body of the issue should start with the URL to the article. Add labels if appropriate, e.g. technical, news, journal, etc.

Curators then get an opportunity to vote. Don't vote for your own submissions. It is assumed you approve of a submission if you created the issue. 3 thumbs up or 3 thumbs down (reaction on issue) is the simple test for publication to the news feed. If a curator votes up or down, they are welcome to add a comment as to why the article should or shouldn't be posted. This allows curators (and viewers) to see the zeitgeist of the curation team at any time around an article. 

Curators can evolve the voting system over time through discussion in the Outreach Committee. New rules of curation will be published here. 

On a weekly basis, issues are closed as either posted or unposted by the lead curators. 

The curation team is:  
* Seth Knox *
* Jesse Schrater *
* Anne Bertuccio *
* Aeva van der Veen *
* Philippe Robin *
... 

An * indicates a lead curator.
